            <h3>Linear Gradients</h3>
            <p>Transitions in linear gradients occur along a straight line determined by an angle or direction. A CSS linear gradient can be coded by using the linear-gradient() function and can be as simple or complex as you would like. At the very least, you’ll only need two colors to get started. From there, you could add more colors, angles, directions, and more to customize your gradient even further.</p>

            <h3>Radial Gradients</h3>
            <p>A CSS radial gradient—although far less often seen—is just as beautiful and fun as a linear gradient and can be implemented just as easily. With that said, the code may seem more difficult to figure out at first. It is for this reason that, for some designers, it may be easier to start out with a linear gradient.</p>
